# MazeOClock_Unity
A slightly different take on the infinite-runner genre, the player is supposed to complete as many mazes as possible for as long as they can keep the timer up - every completed maze gives you extra time depending on the difficulty setting.

The algorithm used to generate the maze is a recursive backtracker, this was one of my first studies on procedural generation on Unity, and my Application worksample for Futuregames in 2021.
